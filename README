.:[ kst: kyle's standard/system tools ]:.

This is stuff I use to get things done. The code is released open
source, but as it's tooling that I wrote for me, I'd be reticent
to receive patches that alter the functionality in ways that I don't
want. I also don't provide support for this. You can ask questions,
I probably won't answer. It's nothing personal, I just probably
don't have time.
