cskel - skeleton files for new C projects
-----------------------------------------
cskel is a skeleton set of files that are useful when making a new C project.


What's included
---------------
I've got a config.sh and Makefile.in that are used to generate code that will
build properly on Linux.


Caveats
-------
This is intended for projects where the codebase resides in the project root,
i.e. not in a src/ directory. It also isn't set up to build libraries.
